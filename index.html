                    small, something else must be small.

                You have so many different things placeholder text has to be able to do, and I
                don't believe Lorem Ipsum has the stamina. It’s about making placeholder text
                great again. That’s what people want, they want placeholder text to be great
                again. That other text? Sadly, it’s no longer a 10. You have so many different
                things placeholder text has to be able to do.
